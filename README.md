Dear Wolt pre-assignment review team,

This is my Wolt intern application pre-assignment. As instructed it is a Python HTTP API which takes delivery details as a POSTed JSON and returns a delivery fee as JSON. The API is built using Flask and the code located in delivery_cost_calculator. The API has been tested in different scenarios and remains in the flask development environment. While I'm sure you already know how to run the environment, just to be sure I know it too I'll explain; within the project folder first enter the virtual environment with 'source venv/bin/activate' and then run the app with the command 'flask --app delivery_cost_calculator run'. It'll open on localhost. The API can be called for example directly with 'curl -X POST [the address] -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @[file path to JSON containing data]'.

The tests can be ran with 'pytest' or 'coverage run -m pytest' and 'coverage report'.

Hope to hear from you soon!


Best Regards,
Otso Aksela
